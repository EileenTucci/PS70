#### Week 6: Electronic Input Devices 

I made a distance capacatice sensor. I took 2 pieces of adhesive copper and I cut them into triangles with the thickest side the farthest away, I stuck them next to each other, but not touching, on a small piece of cardboard.

I atached an alligator clip to each side. I atached one side to A3 and one to pin 4.

Then I used a piece of scrap metal to connect the two copper pieces, which would connect more and less depending on how much copper was under the metal—which depends on the width of the copper triangle piece at different places. This was not recording well, so I put a piece of orange duck tape over the copper to try and stabilize the sensor, and that looked like it worked!

To calibrate the sensor, I measured out every 2 mm from the edge of the cardboard and scored it with a pen. I then took measurements of the capacitance at each spot by looking at where the graph of the print plot put in the middle of the viewframe, or where the computer found the center of the signal, after the reading became more consistent. You have to wait a few seconds because the sensor had a very high reading the instant you put the metal down that messes with the scale of the graph.

I measured with a thin and thick piece of metal I found, and in the center collum I listed some of the outliers I would get with the thin metal piece. If I recorded one of these, I would take the metal off, let it settle, and try again—especially because it seemed to mostly be the same crazy high number that would sometimes show up.

Here is the graph and table of my calibration data:

My other sensor I set up were 2 microphone, where I could calibrate how the recorded by each one is associated with the angle between them that the sound was made from, because I want to use this to calibrate my final project.
