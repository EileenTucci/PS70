#### Week 1: Introduction 

For week 1, I downloaded all of the apps needed for the class including: SublimeText, GitHubDesktop, Arduino, SublimeMerge, and Fusion 360. I read the samples then went to the lab for office hours help with Kasia, where she showed me how to use W3schools and explained the basics of how to get what I type to respond on GitHub. I had some trouble with making the home page appear in a grid with the right size pictures. I used the css to try to make images fill/fit to the size of the original picture from the template. I tried to make a grid from some css, then backtracked and tried to see how the original template did it, and added row commands to use bootstrap to make the grid on the first page.

Then I outlined a possible [final project idea](../finalproject.html)

<!--what was in the template: Here is an image: 

![image of embroidery](./sew.png)

And here is a	[link](../index.html).-->
