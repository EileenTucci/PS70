### Final Project Proposal for 09/6

Eileen is a film student, and something she would like to explore in her final project is an effective audio-adjusting microphone. Essentially, it would record everything in the most optimal range for video editing. Generally, you do this by asking someone to speak loudly and adjusting the gain down on a knob or by pressing a button on a recording device until that persons' voice does not "clip". This means your gain (or sensitivity basically explained here:
[https://mynewmicrophone.com/microphone-gain/](https://mynewmicrophone.com/microphone-gain/) [https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-microphone-gain-how-does-it-affect-recording-volume/](https://www.makeuseof.com/what-is-microphone-gain-how-does-it-affect-recording-volume/)) is as high as it can be so you are recieving the most amount of information to give you the most flexibility when editing. But what if there was an auto-adjusting microphone that tried to keep your speakers' voice in the right range without peaking? The complaint about programs that do this (in some computers, for example [https://www.partitionwizard.com/partitionmanager/how-to-stop-microphone-auto-adjusting-win10.html](https://www.partitionwizard.com/partitionmanager/how-to-stop-microphone-auto-adjusting-win10.html)) is that it might change as you are speaking and you lose variability in what that person says and their tone of voice. You may also have peaking (sound too loud to be propperly recorded) before the microphone adjusts or the microphone flattening or leveling the sound. I wonder if by using two microphones, one that adjusts and one that doesn't, and put them in the same microphone cage recording into two channelsâ€”the editor would be able to get the information and consistency they need to edit sound well and record it efficiently. One microphone would wait to record while sensing a good, safe gain to set, while the other would start sensing when the sound is "peaking" or not being recorded and begin auto adjusting.
<br>
I would fabricate the molds for the microphone cage that holds both recievers and the recieving/recording device as well as the sound recieving technology, which I assume will be somewhat like using the vinyl printer to make a speaker. The input will be the sound and output will be the way it records and stores the sound through a reciever. The microcontroller will control, at the very least, how the gain adjusts in response to what the reciever records.
