#### Week 2: 2D Design and Cutting 

<img src="EileenAboutMe.jpg" alt="Picture of Eileen" width="250" height="300">

The assignment for this week came in three parts: the tutorials, the press-fit design, and the model of two household objects.

Number One: The Tutorials

For my tutorials, I did the one in the class page, youtube link suggestion on the main page, as well as a written tutorial. 

Following the class page tutorial, I made a simple square and then designed four cutouts into the square that would be parametrized to account for cardboard width and kerf. When I went to the laser cutter I made a terrifying discoveryâ€”the design was in the wrong plane! What ever would I do? I want to Ibrahim and he said I shoudld change the plane. I tried that. And then I tried it again. It did not work. I sent the file to Ibrahim and he sent it back to me in the right plane. I believe I may have constrained the square too much to change planes easily. I do not know. And it was not the first unexplained error I would experience along my journey this week.

I printed three of these at the printer. But what else could I do?

In the next tutorial, I did not follow the exact things that the tutorial runner (tutor?) said I should, instead I used all the tools he mentioned in a kind of haphazard array. it was very freeing. I learned a lot of keyboard shortcuts, which is hard to show a picture of, but can be documented in the 30 minutes total they saved when I did not have to click on the individual icons and instead clicked letters on my keyboard to change tools throughout this project. It was thrilling.

I thought I knew what I was doing, a little bit. But I had no idea at all how to model anything in 3D. That last part of the assignment seemed very scary. So I went into the second tutorial page link in the assignment page and skipped through them until I found one on how to build 3D models. Yay! I first made a cylinder, then I made it a bowl (or cylinder without a lid, I guess) and lastlye I added little gear nubs to the bottom and archs between them. In the process I also learned that the "centered" version of tools exist, and how to complete sketches to add new layers, and how to use the circular patters tools.

Number Two: The Press-Fit Woodland Kit

My press-fit sculpture was designed to have two different "views" one as a hedgehog and one as a woodlouse for a cute and creepy woodlanf combination.
