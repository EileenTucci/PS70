#### Week 4: 3D Design, Printing, Scanning

PRINT

For the 3D design I made this week, I wanted to make something that could not be easily replicated with something that was subtractive, like a laser cutter. I wanted a shape that was more abstract or doubled back on itself. My solution was to make two abstract shapes using the "Fine Point Spline" tool, then a smaller version of the same shape inside of it. This way when I extruded the shape I would not be wasting too much platic. I finished the sketches and then used the revolve tool so that the two shapes would revolve around from the same plane, one 180 degrees, and one -180 degrees to create an abstract curvy wheel.

When I exported the file as an STl and put it into the slicer, scaled it down, turned the wheel so the side was on the X plane (so that hopefully it would have the most contact and not fail) and started to print it. Unfortunately, it still failed. I went back into the slicer and exported the file again with "Supports on Build Plate Only" turned on, and the print was a sucess! My only complaint is that the supports end up taking up a lot of the wheel, because I sized it down so much.

SCAN

I wanted to make a scan of an apple using the machine in class. Only I couldn't quite get it to work even when I used the rotating plate. So, instead I used an app on my phone to take pictures as i moved around the apple. Because of how close the apple was to the light it got a little bit unfocused on one side, but overall I am happy with it! Below is a video of the scan because the app I used (Metascan) would not let me download it as a .stl file on the free version.
