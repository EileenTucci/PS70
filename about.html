Eileen is a student in Lowell House studying Comparative Literature and Art, Film, and Visual Studies. She really enjoys music and sings in the Radcliffe Choral Society. She is also directing a musical written by her friends Victoria Gong and Keagan Yap called [Mira, Mira](https://mailchi.mp/55ff6666b4b3/aboutmiramira1). Come see it October 20-22!

  Eileen decided to take this class because of her interest in film. With the tools she learns how to use in this class, she can create her own models and props in a tighter budget. As she learns more she is also excited to learn how to design new apparatuses she can use to film (like more maneuverable tripods or new kinds of microphones).
